# Basic-Front-End-Projects
Welcome to my first collection of front-end projects! These projects represent my initial step into the exciting world of front-end development. Each project was designed to help me build a strong foundation in HTML, CSS while exploring creative ideas and practical skills. 

## Projects include:
  * Panda Photo App
  * Cafe Menu
  * Colored Markers
  * Registration Form
  * Survey Form

## Technologies used:
  * HTML
  * CSS

These projects mark the beginning of my journey as a front-end developer. I'm eager to continue learning, improving, and building more complex projects in the future. Feel free to explore each project and contribute improvement if you'd like!
